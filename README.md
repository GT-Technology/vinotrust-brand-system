# VinoTrust Brand System

VinoTrust is always one word with a capital V and a caplital T.

## Basic service design principles
VinoTrust aims to design services on three basic principles:

### Simple
Wherever possible we strive to make our designs simple to use, easy to navigate and intuitive.
 
### Accessibile
At all times we aim for inclusive designs that all users, regardless of ability, can access and use.
 
### Functional
This means that regardless of how you choose to access our service – be it on a desktop, tablet or mobile - in the office, a warehouse, or out in the vineyard – you’ll have access to a fully-functional experience.

## Design goals
* Create a design language that synthesizes good user centred design with VinoTrust brand values and principles.
* Develop a single underlying approach that unifies the user experience across all services.
* Provide a flexible foundation for innovation and brand expression to cater for a variety of different users.

## Colour palette

Our primary brand colors are Endeavour Blue (#17599B) and Deep Sky Blue (#00C5EF). They are used to provide accessibility, simplicity, and consistency throughout all brand communications.
