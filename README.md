# VinoTrust Brand System

VinoTrust is always one word with a capital V and a caplital T.

## Basic design principles
VinoTrust aims to design services on three basic principles:

### Usability
Wherever possible we strive to make our designs simple to use, easy to navigate and intuitive.
 
### Accessibility
At all times we aim for inclusive designs that all users, regardless of ability, can access and use.
 
### Responsiveness
Our website is fully-responsive and device-agnostic. This means that regardless of how you choose to access our service – be it on a desktop, tablet or mobile - in the office, a warehouse, or out in the vineyard – you’ll have access to a fully-functional experience.

## Logo

Logo should be on nutural white or dark grey backgrounds only. The clearspace around the logo is equal to the height of the logo.
